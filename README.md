## Getting Started
### Installation
This section is skipped as per your request.
            
### Environment Variables
To ensure the API functions correctly, the following environment variable must be set in your server configuration (e.g., Apache/Nginx environment variables or a `.env` file if using `phpdotenv` beyond the `composer.json` indication):

- `JWT_SECRET`: A critical, cryptographically secure random string used for signing JSON Web Tokens.
  *Example*: `JWT_SECRET=your_highly_confidential_and_complex_jwt_signing_key_789ABCDEF`

## API Documentation
### Base URL
This API does not operate from a single, unified base URL. Each endpoint is directly accessible via its respective file path (e.g., `/login.php`, `/jobs/create.php`).

### Endpoints

#### POST /login.php
Authenticates a user by email and password. Upon successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued. **Note**: While a JWT is generated, the primary method for authorizing subsequent requests to job-related API endpoints relies on active server-side sessions (`$_SESSION`).

**Request**:
```
