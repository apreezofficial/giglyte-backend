# üí° GigLyte API: The Freelance Connection Backend

## Overview
GigLyte API is a robust backend system developed in **PHP** leveraging **PDO** for database interactions with **MySQL**. It powers a dynamic freelance platform, connecting clients with skilled freelancers for various job engagements.

## Features
- ‚ú® **User Management**: Secure user registration (multi-step verification) and authentication.
- üíº **Job Board**: Clients can create, manage, and delete job listings with detailed descriptions and skill requirements.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Proposal System**: Freelancers can submit proposals to open jobs, detailing their offers and estimated delivery times.
- ü§ù **Order & Contract Management**: Clients can accept proposals, initiating orders and tracking project progress.
- üí¨ **Real-time Messaging**: Integrated communication system for clients and freelancers to discuss project details.
- üì§ **Work Submission**: Freelancers can submit completed work, with options for file uploads.
- üîÑ **Order Status Updates**: Clients and freelancers can update order statuses throughout the project lifecycle.
- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes PHP Sessions for managing user state after login, with JWT generation for potential future stateless API usage.
- üìä **Database Schema Management**: Automated database table creation and updates on startup via `query.php`.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required for the application to run correctly. It is recommended to create a `.env` file in the project root and load these variables.

| Variable Name   | Example Value                       | Description                               |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET`    | `your_super_secret_jwt_key_here`    | Secret key for JWT encoding/decoding.     |
| `DB_HOST`       | `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`          | Database host address.                    |
| `DB_NAME`       | `giglyte`                           | Name of the MySQL database.               |
| `DB_USER`       | `root`                              | Username for database access.             |
| `DB_PASS`       | `password`                          | Password for database access.             |

**Note:** The current `db_connect.php` hardcodes database credentials. For production, these should be loaded from environment variables using `getenv()` similar to `JWT_SECRET` for enhanced security and flexibility.

## Usage
This backend provides a comprehensive set of API endpoints to manage a freelance marketplace.

### Authentication Flow
1.  **Register as a User (Step 1)**: Send a POST request to `/signup.php?step=one` with your email and password. This creates a temporary user and provides a token for the next step.
2.  **Verify Email (Step 2)**: Use the token received in Step 1 to send a GET request to `/signup.php?step=two`. This verifies the email and prepares for the final registration step.
3.  **Complete Registration (Step 3)**: With the verified session, send a POST request to `/signup.php?step=three` to provide full name, username, and role, finalizing the account creation.
4.  **Login**: Once registered, send a POST request to `/login.php` with your email and password. A successful login will return user details and establish a PHP session, which is used for subsequent authenticated requests.

### Job Management (Clients)
As a client, you can:
-   **Create Jobs**: Post new job opportunities, specifying title, description, budget, and required skills.
-   **Manage Jobs**: Edit details of your existing job listings or delete them if no longer needed.
-   **View Proposals**: Browse all proposals submitted by freelancers for your open jobs.
-   **Accept Proposals**: Accept a suitable proposal, which initiates an order for the job.

### Freelancer Operations
As a freelancer, you can:
-   **List Jobs**: View all open job opportunities posted by clients.
-   **Apply to Jobs**: Submit a proposal with a cover letter, proposed amount, and estimated days for open jobs.
-   **View Orders**: See all ongoing and completed orders where you are the assigned freelancer.
-   **Submit Work**: Deliver completed work for an accepted order, including a message and optional file upload.

### Communication & Order Tracking
-   **Send Messages**: Communicate with the client or freelancer involved in a specific job/order.
-   **Get Messages**: Retrieve the conversation history for a particular job.
-   **Update Order Status**: Both clients and freelancers can update the status of an order (e.g., 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled') following specific role-based rules.

## API Documentation
### Base URL
The API endpoints are located at the root of your server deployment (e.g., `http://localhost/` or `https://api.yourdomain.com/`).

All authenticated endpoints require an active PHP session. After a successful login, the session is managed automatically by your browser. For API clients, ensure your HTTP client is configured to handle cookies for session management.
